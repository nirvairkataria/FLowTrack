## Getting Started

### 1. Download

- Download the latest release `.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/nirvairkataria/FLowTrack/releases)  
  *(or build from source‚Äîsee below)*

### 2. First Run

- On first launch, you‚Äôll be prompted to select your FL Studio executable.
- The app will create a `backups` folder for your projects.

### 3. Google Drive Integration (Optional)

To use Google Drive features, the app requires a `client_secrets.json` file:

- **If using the pre-built `.exe`:**  
  Google Drive should work out of the box (if bundled).  
  If not, see below.

- **If building from source:**  
  1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  2. Create a project, enable the Google Drive API, and download your `client_secrets.json`.
  3. Place it in the same folder as `flowtrack_gui.py`.
  4. (See `client_secrets_TEMPLATE.json` for the required format.)

### Please note
If you are using a version of FL Studio **older than 24.1.1**, you must build the project from source and replace the `empty_template.flp` file with an empty project file created from your own version of FL Studio, in order to be able to create new projects directly from the FLowTrack application. Otherwise, you must manually upload flp files after creating them through FL Studio.
